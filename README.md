## üìú Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing an **e-commerce dataset** using Python. The goal is to derive meaningful insights through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and uncover trends and patterns that can drive business decisions.

## üîç Purpose
- Understand customer purchasing behaviors.
- Analyze sales trends over time.
- Identify missing data and handle data cleaning.
- Create visualizations to represent findings effectively.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Libraries
This project is implemented in a **Jupyter Notebook** and utilizes the following libraries:

- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For static visualizations.
- **Plotly**: For interactive visualizations.
- **Scipy**: For statistical analysis.
- **Missingno**: To visualize missing data patterns.
- **Warnings**: To handle warnings.
- **IPython**: For advanced Jupyter Notebook features.

## üß© Methods
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Identified and handled missing values using `Missingno`.
   - Converted date columns into proper datetime formats for time-series analysis.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzed sales trends by day, month, and year.
   - Explored customer behavior through metrics like average order value and product popularity.
   - Visualized correlations and distributions of key features.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Created static visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
   - Developed interactive dashboards using Plotly to enhance data exploration.

## üìä Results
- **Sales Trends**: Identified peak sales periods and seasonal patterns.
- **Customer Insights**: Uncovered the most popular product categories and purchasing patterns.
- **Correlations**: Found significant relationships between key features such as sales and time.

## üìù Outcome
This analysis provides actionable insights into customer behaviors and sales trends, empowering businesses to make data-driven decisions and optimize their e-commerce strategies.
